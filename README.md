# odin-recipes
This is my first real project with the odin project, it is called odin recipes and its going to test my fundamental knowledge on the likes of github as I will be trying to commit as much as possible and the project itself. 
At the end of this project I hope I can be fundamentally strong and use github functions correctly.
